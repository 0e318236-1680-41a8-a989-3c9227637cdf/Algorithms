Algos in Python
======

Implementation for the algorithms and datastructures taught in Coursera course -
[Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo), in Python

This repo contains code from both the classes 1 & 2 and is under progress.
Code contains accompanying test code - doctests for few and full unittests for others
